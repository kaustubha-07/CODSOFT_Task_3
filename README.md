<h2>MOVIE RATING PREDICTION WITH PYTHON</h2>
<li>Build a model that predicts the rating of a movie based on
features like genre, director, and actors. You can use regression
techniques to tackle this problem.</li>
<li>The goal is to analyze historical movie data and develop a model
that accurately estimates the rating given to a movie by users or
critics.</li>
<li>Movie Rating Prediction project enables you to explore data
analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine
learning modeling techniques.</li> 
<li>It provides insights into the factors
that influence movie ratings and allows you to build a model that
can estimate the ratings of movies accurately.</li>
